# Coal Mines Carbon Footprint & Carbon Neutrality Initiative

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the carbon footprint of coal mining operations and proposes strategies to move towards carbon neutrality. The goal is to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal extraction, transportation, and processing, and suggest ways to reduce the environmental impact. We also explore clean energy alternatives and carbon offset programs to help the industry adopt sustainable practices.

## Objectives
- **Measure Carbon Footprint:** Calculate and track GHG emissions in coal mining operations.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyze historical emissions data to identify trends and inefficiencies.
- **Transition to Carbon Neutrality:** Propose strategies such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy integration, and carbon offsetting.
- **Recommendations:** Offer insights for coal companies to reduce their carbon footprint and adopt more sustainable practices.

## Key Features
- **Emissions Tracking:** Tool to measure CO2 and other GHG emissions in real time.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and charts to track emissions trends and project potential reductions.
- **Clean Energy Integration:** Suggestions for renewable energy adoption to offset coal-related emissions.
- **Carbon Offset Programs:** Evaluation of carbon offset projects for coal industries.
